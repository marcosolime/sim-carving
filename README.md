# 3D Volume Reconstruction from Cylindrical Ray Casting

This project demonstrates a simple 3D reconstruction technique using **ray casting** around an object, inspired by photo-thermoelectric (PTE) imaging concepts. Rays are generated from a cylindrical distribution around the target (a cube) and cast inward. Each ray has a binary transmission value:  
- **1 (transmitted)** means the ray passes through without hitting the object.  
- **0 (blocked)** means the ray intersects the cube, and the corresponding voxels along the rayâ€™s interior path are marked as filled.  

The algorithm reconstructs the 3D volume by progressively filling the grid with information inferred from blocked rays. The result is saved as a `.npy` file for further visualization and analysis.
